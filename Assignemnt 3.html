    a fun book on living life, with the wisdom of a manual but without the seriousness. It helps you figure out WHY 
    bad things happen? WHY some people are rich while others aren’t? 
    WHY bills come in bunches? and why it all seems to work in a patten. 
    The good news: you are not your patterns and YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR 
    PATTERNS. This book shows you the nuts and bolts of life. It looks 
    at your thoughts and how they shape your life and shows you how to 
    change them to attract good health, prosperity and happiness. With 
    lots of happy cartoons and sketches by the author - Andrew Mattews
